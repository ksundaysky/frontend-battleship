# ABOUT Battleship

Client module of web application BattleShip
Battleship is a guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships are marked.
The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, 
and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
